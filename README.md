# MazeSolver
Java program that solves a given maze.


NOTE: This repository only contains the files which I coded myself. Any other files needed to run this program can be found in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hWj1shDP_rI2g3nS1gWtHVtiEPrMI2Pe?usp=drive_link). These files DO NOT belong to me. Read the disclaimer within the folder for more details.


HOW TO RUN THE FILES ON YOUR OWN:
1. Create a new Java project (do not make a package, use the deafult).

2. Extract the files in src_provided_files.zip and place them in the src folder. Place the 3 java files in this repository in the src folder.

3. Extract the images in other_provided_files.zip and place them in the project folder (the parent folder of the src folder).

4. Provide the name of one of the maze files as the argument for Solve.java and run the program.

5. Follow the instructions in the CLI and watch the maze get solved!


Here is a demonstration of how the game should run:
